# About
- Simulates an attendance system that uses face and voice recognition to verify a user, with fake detection added as well.
- Made with Python, OpenCV, MongoDB and Gradio.

# How to use
- Register your name, face (fakes will be rejected) and voice as a new user (don't worry, the actual face won't be stored, the image will be converted into numeric embeddings instead when stored in the database).
- Go to the Verify User tab to test the attendance system and follow the instructions shown. (The processing might take a few seconds so be patient if the output display text doesn't change immediately.
